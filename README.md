BeerJS Orem
============

BeerJS Orem is for devs to get together, throw a few back, and play with JavaScript. We value good beer and good code and encourage the sharing of both.

Want to hang out?
-----------------

So I'm just a guy living in a house by UVU and wanted to have some good chill devs to come hang out. I normally have a few beers on hand, though bringing beer is encouraged. I normally will be hacking on MithrilJS or Node, but you can bring whatever you want to come jam. I'll probably set a weekly time, and whoever shows up shows up. Nothing too structured, more just socializing, drinking, and hacking. Maybe throw on some vinyl to listen to while we do.

Click the watch button for this repo to get notified of upcoming meeting dates or date and location changes.  Don't forget to star BeerJS Orem too. Once I actually get a watcher or two I'll set up a weekly time.

Also feel free to come with problems and questions about your code, my code, or whatever. I am more than happy to mentor if you need one, or just be a second pair of eyes on your code.

Want to bring beer?
------------------

Of course you do.  Like I said, I'll have a few on hand, normally Squatters.
